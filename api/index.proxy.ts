/**
 * This file demonstrates how you can use the ZEIT Now Server as a proxy layer that
 * sits between your pricing/hedging server and the end users who request quotes and orders.
 * This could be beneficial if you alrady have an isolated pricing server that generates your quotes and orders.
 * ZEIT takes care of the web layer so you don't have to worry about CORS and SSL,
 * and all quote/order requests will be forwarded to your remote server.
